## General Information:

This study addresses the following research question: how does fish length predict fish weight for trout perch across all sample years?

The data package, "North Temperate Lakes LTER: Fish Lengths and Weights 1981" was used for this study and it includes data on various fish species in 11 lakes from 1981 to 2022. 

## Data and file overview:

There are 5 files in this package

1. "knb-lter-ntl.6.34.report.xml" checks document validity.
2. "knb-lter-ntl.6.34.txt" contains detailed metadata on methods, variables, and dataset.
3. "knb-lter-ntl.6.34.xml" same as "knb-lter-ntl.6.34.txt" but in .xml format.
4. "manifest.txt" is the manifest file for the data package.
5. "ntl6_v12.csv" contains the sample data with 15 variables and 349299 observations. The variables include lake, year, sample date, gear type, species name, sample type, depth, replicate number, individual ID, length, weight, sex, fish part, spseq, and flag for each observation of fish.
